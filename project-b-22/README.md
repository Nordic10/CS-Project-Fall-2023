# Django Camping Review App
## About
This app is designed to allow users to view nearby campsites in an organized fashion, as well as leave comments about the specific qualities of a campsite.

## Background
This app is an project assignment for Advanced Software Development (CS3240) at the University of Virginia. The goal of this project is to create a web app that gives information to the user based on some known location. The constraints are that we must use Django as our development framework, Heroku to host our web server, google login api to implement admin and user interfaces, and google maps api for location data.
